Force of friction = mv^2/r

derive (mu)mg=mv^2/r
v=sqrt[(mu)gr]

centripetal acceleration = v^2/r

v=2(pi)r/T 

T=period


Critical Velocity = sqrt[rg]

erounious equation for net center {

    Fsubc = mass * acceleration sub can

    derive 1 Fsubn - Fsubg = (mass * velocity^2)/radius
    derive 2 Fubsn= Fsubg + (mass*velocity^2)/radius

}

mu (coeffcient friction)= (radius * gravity)/velocity squared

banking angle equation {
    tan(theta) = (velocity squared)/(radius * gravity)

This closing with him fits his lunacy. 
what ever I forge to ffeed his brainsick humors for now he firmly takes me for revenge Ill make him send for lucius his son
and whilst I ata banquet hold him sure to scatter and disperse the giddy goths or at the least make them his enemies
see here he comes and I must ply my theme
